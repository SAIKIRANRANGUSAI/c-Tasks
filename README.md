HMI System Simulation
This project simulates key features of an automotive HMI system using C++. It covers menu navigation, instrument cluster data display, touchscreen event handling, and skin customization.

Tasks
Menu Navigation System:

Implement a hierarchical menu (Main Menu, Settings, Display Settings, etc.).
Use keyboard input to navigate (1 for down, 2 for up, 3 to enter).
Instrument Cluster Data Display:

Simulate and display speed, fuel level, and engine temperature.
Update data every second using multithreading, with warnings for abnormal values.
Event Handling for Touchscreen Input:

Process touchscreen events like Tap and Swipe.
Simulate event queue handling and display messages.
HMI Skin Customization:

Manage themes (Classic, Sport, Eco) with customizable attributes (background color, font, etc.).
Allow users to preview and apply themes.
